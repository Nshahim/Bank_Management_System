The project is designed to manage Customer's Bank Accounts.
A series of different functions were created to achieve the tasks.
The Menu function displays the menu for the user to choose an option from and everytime a fucntion is done, the user can select to move back to the menu.
A create User Account function will ask the customer to input data for the account and save them using a unique ID for that particular user.
